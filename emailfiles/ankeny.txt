As a service to residents, the City of Ankeny provides information related to area businesses. This information is submitted and maintained by business-owners and organized by the website’s content management system.

The City will not specifically endorse any businesses listed. Those included in the directory do so at their own discretion.

Annually, the City of Ankeny will send an e-mail to all business owners to confirm they are still operational. We do so to ensure that directory information is up-to-date. Business owners that do not reply within one month of the confirmation e-mail will have their listing removed from the database.

Should you see a business listed that is no longer within Ankeny, please let us know by going to Services > Submit Service Request > Business Directory > Closed Business. Your help is greatly appreciated!

If your business category is not listed, please notify us by going to Services > Submit Service Request > Business Directory > Add Category.
