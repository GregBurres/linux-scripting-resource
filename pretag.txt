Copy the lamp.h file to current working directory after you have copied the file you will need to allow scripts to run on your machine.

<pre> chmod +x lamp.sh </pre>

Once you have enabled scripts to run on your machine you will need start running the script.

<pre> sudo ./lamp.sh </pre>

Let's examine the script to see what it does after the echo statements we update all the repositries on the machine.

<pre> sudo apt-get update </pre>

Then we proceed to install the Apache server on the local machine.

<pre> sudo apt-get -y install apache2 </pre>

Now need set the root password for MySQL using debconf we are setting the root password to MYPASSWORD123.

<pre>s udo debconf-set-selections <<< 'mysql-server mysql-server/root_password password MYPASSWORD123'
sudo debconf-set-selections <<< 'mysql-server mysql-server/root_password_again password MYPASSWORD123' </pre>

After setting the root password we can now install MySQL Server.

<pre> sudo apt-get -y install mysql-server mysql-client </pre>

Finally we are now going to install PHP7.0 with MySQL, Curl, Json and CGI configured along with Apache2.

<pre>sudo apt-get -y install php7.0-mysql php7.0-curl php7.0-json php7.0-cgi php7.0 libapache2-mod-php7 </pre>

The last thing we need to do is restart the system and verify it works

<pre> sudo systemctl restart apache2 </pre>
