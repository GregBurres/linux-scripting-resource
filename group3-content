What is a regular expression?
A regular expression, also called a “regex”, is a pattern that describes a set of text strings. This pattern is used by string searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings. Usually a regex contains characters (for literal meaning), anchors (the position in the text, such as ^, $) and modifier (to expand or narrow the range of text, such as *, \).

Regex are divided into 3 different types:
1. Basic regular expressions
2. Interval regular expressions
3. Extended regular expressions

Here are the commonly used basic regular expressions:
Symbol          Description
. (dot)         a single character
?               the preceding character matches 0 or 1 times only
*               the preceding character matches 0 or more times
+               the preceding character matches 1 or more times
()              group several characters to behave as one
|               the logical OR operation
^               matches the beginning of the string
$               matches the end of the string
 



What are grep and sed command?
Grep is short for “Global Regular Expression Print”. Grep command is used to search texts or files that match the given pattern and print the matching result.
