First, if you don't already have it, you will need to install the command line utility suite ImageMagick:

<---start code-->
sudo apt-get install imagemagick
# sudo is the command that tells Linux to run the following command as root
# apt is the Advanced Packaging Tool, and apt-get tells it to find and download the tool that is named
# install tells it to install
# imagemagick is the name of the package

<--end code-->


<--start code-->
# figure out how to maintain the image name during conversion
# move files to a different directory for final files
convert ~/images-raw/*.png -quality 95 *.jpg
# converts any png image in the images-raw directory into jpg files with a 95% compression
convert ~/images-raw/*.gif -quality 95 *.jpg
# converts any gif image in the images-raw directory into jpg files with a 95% compression
convert ~/images-raw/*.jpg -resize x500 *.jpg
# resizes any jpg image in the images-raw directory to a height of 500 pixels, maintaining aspect ratio

<--end code-->
